Introduction Book is a Markdown-based language that simplifies the creation of AI applications, workflows, and automations. With human-readable commands, you can define inputs, outputs, personas, knowledge sources, and actions—without needing model-specific details. Example Each part of the book defines one of 3 circles: 1. What: Workflows, Tasks and Parameters What work needs to be done. Each book defines a workflow (scenario or pipeline), which is one or more tasks. Each workflow has a fixed input and output. For example, you have a book that generates an article from a topic. Once it generates an article about AI, once about marketing, once about cooking. The workflow (= your AI program) is the same, only the input and output change. Related commands: 2. Who: Personas Who does the work. Each task is performed by a persona. A persona is a description of your virtual employee. It is a higher abstraction than the model, tokens, temperature, top-k, top-p and other model parameters. You can describe what you want in human language like Jane, creative writer with a sense of sharp humour instead of gpt-4-2024-13-31, temperature 1.2, top-k 40, STOP token \".\\n\",.... Personas can have access to different knowledge, tools and actions. They can also consult their work with other personas or user, if allowed. Related commands: 3. How: Knowledge, Instruments and Actions The resources used by the personas are used to do the work. Related commands: KNOWLEDGE of documents, websites, and other resources INSTRUMENT for real-time data like time, location, weather, stock prices, searching the internet, calculations, etc. ACTION for actions like sending emails, creating files, ending a workflow, etc. General Principles Book language is based on markdown. It is subset of markdown. It is designed to be easy to read and write. It is designed to be understandable by both humans and machines and without specific knowledge of the language. The file has .book extension. It uses UTF-8 non BOM encoding. Book has two variants: flat - which is just a prompt with no structure, and full - which has a structure with tasks, commands and prompts. As it is source code, it can leverage all the features of version control systems like git and does not suffer from the problems of binary formats, proprietary formats, or no-code solutions. But unlike programming languages, it is designed to be understandable by non-programmers and non-technical people. 📚 Documentation See detailed guides and API reference in the docs or online. 🔒 Security For information on reporting security vulnerabilities, see our Security Policy. 📦 Packages (for developers) This library is divided into several packages, all are published from single monorepo.

Introduction Book is a Markdown-based language that simplifies the creation of AI applications, workflows, and automations. With human-readable commands, you can define inputs, outputs, personas, knowledge sources, and actions—without needing model-specific details. Example Each part of the book defines one of 3 circles: 1. What: Workflows, Tasks and Parameters What work needs to be done. Each book defines a workflow (scenario or pipeline), which is one or more tasks. Each workflow has a fixed input and output. For example, you have a book that generates an article from a topic. Once it generates an article about AI, once about marketing, once about cooking. The workflow (= your AI program) is the same, only the input and output change. Related commands: 2. Who: Personas Who does the work. Each task is performed by a persona. A persona is a description of your virtual employee. It is a higher abstraction than the model, tokens, temperature, top-k, top-p and other model parameters. You can describe what you want in human language like Jane, creative writer with a sense of sharp humour instead of gpt-4-2024-13-31, temperature 1.2, top-k 40, STOP token \".\\n\",.... Personas can have access to different knowledge, tools and actions. They can also consult their work with other personas or user, if allowed. Related commands: 3. How: Knowledge, Instruments and Actions The resources used by the personas are used to do the work. Related commands: KNOWLEDGE of documents, websites, and other resources INSTRUMENT for real-time data like time, location, weather, stock prices, searching the internet, calculations, etc. ACTION for actions like sending emails, creating files, ending a workflow, etc. General Principles Book language is based on markdown. It is subset of markdown. It is designed to be easy to read and write. It is designed to be understandable by both humans and machines and without specific knowledge of the language. The file has .book extension. It uses UTF-8 non BOM encoding. Book has two variants: flat - which is just a prompt with no structure, and full - which has a structure with tasks, commands and prompts. As it is source code, it can leverage all the features of version control systems like git and does not suffer from the problems of binary formats, proprietary formats, or no-code solutions. But unlike programming languages, it is designed to be understandable by non-programmers and non-technical people. 📚 Documentation See detailed guides and API reference in the docs or online. 🔒 Security For information on reporting security vulnerabilities, see our Security Policy. 📦 Packages (for developers) This library is divided into several packages, all are published from single monorepo.
