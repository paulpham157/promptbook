The future of software is in plain English, French or Latin.\n\nDuring the computer revolution, we have seen multiple generations of computer languages, from the physical rewiring of the vacuum tubes through low-level machine code to the high-level languages like Python or JavaScript. And now, we're on the edge of the next revolution!\n\nIt's a revolution of writing software in plain human language that is understandable and executable by both humans and machines – and it's going to change everything!\n\nThe incredible growth in power of microprocessors and the Moore's Law have been the driving force behind the ever-more powerful languages, and it's been an amazing journey! Similarly, the large language models (like GPT or Claude) are the next big thing in language technology, and they're set to transform the way we interact with computers.\n\nThis shift is going to happen, whether we are ready for it or not.
